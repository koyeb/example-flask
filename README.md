## About Koyeb and the Flask example application

Koyeb is a developer-friendly serverless platform to deploy apps globally. No-ops, servers, or infrastructure management.
This repository contains a Flask application you can deploy on the Koyeb serverless platform for testing.

This example application is designed to show how a Flask application can be deployed on Koyeb.

## Getting Started

### Deploy using the Koyeb button

The fastest way to deploy the Flask application is to click the **Deploy to Koyeb** button below.

_To modify this application example, you will need to fork this repository. Checkout the [fork and deploy](#fork-and-deploy-to-koyeb) instructions._

### Fork and deploy to Koyeb

If you want to customize and enhance this application, you need to fork this repository.

If you used the **Deploy to Koyeb** button, you can simply link your service to your forked repository to be able to push changes.
Alternatively, you can manually create the application as described below.

On the [Koyeb Control Panel](//app.koyeb.com/apps), on the **Overview** tab, click the **Create Web Service** button to begin.

1. Select **GitHub** as the deployment method.
2. In the repositories list, select the repository you just forked.
3. In the **Builder** section, click the **override** toggle associated with the **Run command** and enter `gunicorn app:app` in the field.
4. Choose a name for your App and Service, i.e `flask-on-koyeb`, and click **Deploy**.

You land on the deployment page where you can follow the build of your Flask application. Once the build is completed, your application is being deployed and you will be able to access it via `<YOUR_APP_NAME>-<YOUR_ORG_NAME>.koyeb.app`.
